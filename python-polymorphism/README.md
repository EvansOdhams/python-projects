# Python Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

## Method Overriding
Method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in its superclass. The method in the subclass overrides the implementation of the method in the superclass, allowing the subclass to provide its own implementation.
