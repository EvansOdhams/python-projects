# Python Inheritance
Python inheritance is a powerful object-oriented programming concept that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and extensibility by creating a hierarchical structure among classes.

This README provides an overview of Python inheritance, its syntax, and some best practices to follow when working with inheritance in Python.

	Types of Inheritance
	Python supports the following types of inheritance:

	Single inheritance: A class inherits from a single base class.
	Multiple inheritance: A class inherits from multiple base classes.
	Multilevel inheritance: A class inherits from a derived class, which further inherits from another class.
	Hierarchical inheritance: Multiple classes inherit from a single base class.
	Hybrid inheritance: It is a combination of multiple inheritance types.
