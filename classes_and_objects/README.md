# Python Classes and Objects
Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means it provides support for creating and working with classes and objects. Classes are blueprints for creating objects, and objects are instances of a class that encapsulate data and functionality. This readme file serves as a quick reference guide for working with classes and objects in Python.
