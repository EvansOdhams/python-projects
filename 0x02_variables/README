What are Variables?
In Python, a variable is a named reference to a value stored in the computer's memory. Variables allow us to store and manipulate data during the execution of a program. They act as containers for holding values of various types, such as numbers, strings, or objects.

Declaring Variables
In Python, you can declare a variable by assigning a value to it using the assignment operator (=). You don't need to specify the type explicitly; Python dynamically infers the type based on the assigned value. For example:

python
Copy code
name = "John"
age = 25
is_student = True
Variable Naming Conventions
Follow these guidelines when naming variables:

Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.
Use lowercase letters and underscores for improved readability.
Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names (e.g., for, if, while).
Start variable names with a letter or underscore (e.g., _count, name, age).
Don't use special characters like @, #, or $ in variable names.
Assigning Values
You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=). Here are some examples:

python
Copy code
x = 10            # Assigning an integer value
name = "Alice"    # Assigning a string value
is_valid = True   # Assigning a boolean value
Variables can also be reassigned to new values as needed:

python
Copy code
x = 20            # Reassigning a new value to an existing variable
Variable Types
Python is a dynamically typed language, which means variables can hold values of different types. Some common variable types in Python include:

Integers: x = 10
Floats: y = 3.14
Strings: name = "Alice"
Booleans: is_valid = True
Lists: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Tuples: point = (2, 5)
Dictionaries: person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
You can use the type() function to determine the type of a variable:

python
Copy code
x = 10
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'int'>
Variable Scope
The scope of a variable defines its visibility and accessibility within the program. Python has two main types of variable scope:

Global scope: Variables declared outside any function or class have global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
Local scope: Variables declared within a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function.
python
Copy code
x = 10               # Global variable

def my_function():
    y = 20           # Local variable
    print(x + y)     # Output: 30

my_function()
Best Practices
Use meaningful and descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
Initialize variables with appropriate default values to avoid errors.
Avoid using global variables unless necessary to minimize unintended side effects.
Minimize the scope of variables by declaring them
