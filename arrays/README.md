# Python Arrays
In Python, arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are similar to lists but have some specific characteristics. This README provides an overview of Python arrays, including their features, creation, manipulation, and common operations.

## Introduction to Arrays
An array is a data structure that can hold a fixed number of elements of the same type. Arrays in Python are implemented using the array module, which provides a high-performance alternative to the built-in list type. The elements in an array are indexed starting from zero, allowing for efficient access and manipulation.

## Some key characteristics of arrays include:

Arrays are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified.
They can store elements of any data type (e.g., integers, floats, characters, etc.).
Arrays have a fixed size that is determined at the time of creation.
Elements in an array are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient traversal.
