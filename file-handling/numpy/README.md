## NumPy Home

The NumPy home page provides an overview of the library and its capabilities. You can find it at [https://numpy.org](https://numpy.org).

## NumPy Introduction

NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides high-performance multidimensional arrays and tools for working with them efficiently. NumPy is widely used in scientific and data analysis applications.

## Getting Started

To use NumPy, you need to install it first. You can install it using pip by running the command `pip install numpy`. Once installed, you can import it in your Python script using the `import numpy as np` statement.

## Creating Arrays

NumPy arrays are the central data structure in NumPy. They are similar to Python lists, but more efficient for numerical computations. You can create NumPy arrays using various methods, such as `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, etc. This section covers different ways to create arrays.

## Array Indexing

Array indexing in NumPy is similar to Python lists. You can access elements of an array using square brackets and indices. This section explains how to access individual elements and subarrays using indexing.

## Array Slicing

NumPy arrays support slicing, which allows you to access subarrays. Slicing is done using the colon `:` operator. This section covers slicing techniques to extract specific portions of an array.

## Data Types

NumPy provides a wide range of data types for arrays. These data types are more efficient and flexible than Python's built-in data types. This section introduces the different data types available in NumPy and how to specify them.

## Copy vs View

Understanding the concepts of copy and view in NumPy is essential to avoid unexpected behavior. When you manipulate arrays, it's important to know if you're modifying the original array or creating a new one. This section explains the difference between copying an array and creating a view.

## Array Shape

The shape of an array in NumPy refers to its dimensions. It determines the number of rows, columns, or layers in the array. This section covers how to check and modify the shape of an array using the `shape` attribute.

## Array Reshape

Reshaping an array means changing its shape without modifying its data. NumPy provides the `reshape()` function to modify the shape of an array. This section explains how to reshape arrays to different dimensions.

## Array Iterating

NumPy provides several methods to iterate over arrays efficiently. This section covers different iteration techniques, such as iterating over elements, rows, and columns of an array.

## Array Join

Joining or concatenating arrays is a common operation in NumPy. You can concatenate arrays along different axes or dimensions. This section explains how to join arrays using the `concatenate()` and `stack()` functions.

## Array Split

Splitting arrays is the opposite of joining them. You can split an array into multiple smaller arrays. This section covers how to split arrays using the `split()` and `hsplit()` functions.

## Array Search

NumPy provides methods to search for specific elements in an array. You can search for elements that meet certain conditions or find the indices of specific values. This section covers how to search arrays using functions like `where()` and `nonzero()`.

## Array Sort

Sorting arrays is a fundamental operation in data analysis. NumPy provides functions to sort arrays in different orders. This section covers how to sort arrays using functions like `sort()` and `argsort()`.

## Array Filter

Filtering arrays allows you to extract elements that satisfy certain conditions. NumPy provides methods for applying boolean masks to arrays to filter out specific values. This section explains how to filter arrays using boolean indexing.
