# Python Functions
Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They provide modularity and abstraction, allowing you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. This readme provides an overview of Python functions along with code examples.

## Defining a Function
In Python, you can define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. You can also specify parameters inside the parentheses if the function requires input values. The function body is indented below the function definition.

def function_name(parameters):
# function body
# code statements
